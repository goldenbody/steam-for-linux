Good day & thanks for your time

For current version CS2, RAW Input is force-opening (Normally Open). And we could not have it disabled....

Why do you force to disable default Windows mouse acceleration settings (Enhanced Pointer Precision) for CS2?

It is something like you force right-hander people to use left hand to operate. It really kills...

We are not cheaters in game, but we can bear and live with cheaters all these years. This is how we love. 

But is Windows mouse acceleration settings (Enhanced Pointer Precision) must be removed? It is also an excellent option in history indeed, bringing no harms to the game, catering to another group of human who are gifted or talented at wrist-control. This is how people love the game.

Truth is that there had been already a great amount of CS players get used to it (me included). How will we 100% accept this current CS2?

At least, it is reasonable to give 2 options of "mouse setting" for the human. Enable Raw Input or Disable Raw Input & Enable default Windows mouse acceleration option (Enhanced Pointer Precision). Keep this same as CSGO.

Grateful that default Windows mouse acceleration settings (Enhanced Pointer Precision) could be back by next upgrade.

Thanks with love again for having your time and support
